A false positive is where SEP indicates that an email is an attack whereas, in fact, it isn\u2019t. Especially in a large organization, if SEP were to check for address\/name similarity against all employees, then many more incoming emails would be flagged as potential social engineering attacks\u2026 whereas, in fact, many of those would just be emails from people who happened to have the same name as someone within the your organization.",
			"sep_vip_more3": "In small organizations, the false-positive risk diminishes. If your organization is <100 users, you might like to try assigning all of your users as VIPs. If you do this, pay particular attention to false positives via the SEP Reporting. If you see many emails being caught because of name \/ address VIP similarity, then thin out the VIPs.",
